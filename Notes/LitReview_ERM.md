# [Fatal Police Shootings Of Unarmed Black People Reveal Troubling Patterns](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/25/956177021/fatal-police-shootings-of-unarmed-black-people-reveal-troubling-patterns)
National Public Radio (Jan. 25, 2021) 
## Summary 
  NPR examined the fatal shootings of 135 unarmed Black men and women who were killed by police officers in the U.S. since 2015, reviewing incident reports and case files, as well as job applications, personnel records, use-of-force reports, citizen complaints, court records, lawsuits, news releases and witness statements. 
## Notes
  Findings: 
  - at least 75% of officers involved in shootings were White 
  - 15 officers had been involved in more than one shooting 
  - 6 officers had troubled pasts before being hired 
  - several officers were convicted of crimes while licensed police officers 
  - more than 24 officers had citizen complaints or use of force incidents 
  - 19 officers were rookies 
  - killings resulted in 30 judgements totaling $142 million

## Summary
  In this opinion piece, Donald W. Bohlken – an attorney from Indianola, Iowa – parses The Washington Post's data showing 14 Black and 25 White "unarmed" Americans were shot and killed by police in 2019 and determines that the data does not "add up to a narrative of numerous police officers indiscriminately murdering unarmed Black men." 
## Notes
 - makes a good point: the label "unarmed" is misleading – two had cars, one had a stun gun and two others had guns

## Summary
  In this opinion piece, assistant professors Dean Knox and Jonathan Mummulo detail the problems with research published in – and then retracted from – the Proceedings of the National Academies of Science that examined fatal police shootings in the U.S. and determined that there was no evidence of anti-Black or anti-Hispanic disparities. 
## Notes
 - should have asked: "How often do officers use fatal force _out of all encounters between minority civilians and the police?_" but instead analyzed _how often fatally shot civilians were Black and Hispanic_
 - failed to account for the fact that when officers encounter more white civilians in general, more white people are shot by police. 
 - In trying to figure out if white officers were more likely to shoot minority civilians (compared to minority officers), researchers looked at civilians killed by each racial officer group and asked whether the proportion of minority victims differed. They did not find a strong relationship. 
 - Researchers attributed shootings of minorities to "violent crime committed by Black [or Hispanic] civilians" in the counties where shootings took place (based erroneously on data of the victims of violent crime)
 - "How often fatally shot civilians were minorities is simply not the same question as how often minority civilians were shot when interacting with officers."
 - article states the paper was [condemned](https://medium.com/@jon.mummolo/prominent-claims-that-policing-is-not-racially-biased-rest-on-flawed-science-6f66535dc7e5) for scientific malpractice by more than 800 academics and researchers

Yale News (October 27, 2020) 
## Summary
  This news story summarizes research in the [Journal of Epidemiology and Public Health](https://jech.bmj.com/content/early/2020/10/20/jech-2020-215097) that analyzed The Washington Post's Fatal Force data from 2015 - 2020 and found that "victims identifying as Black, Indigenous, or People of Color (BIPOC), whether armed or unarmed, had significantly higher death rates compared with whites." Additionally, those numbers were largely unchanged from 2015 to 2020.  															
## Notes
 - there was a small but statistically significant decline in White deaths (about 1%) but no significant change in deaths for BIPOC 
 - Native Americans were killed by police at a rate 3x that of White people 
 - Black people were killed at 2.6x the rate of White people 
 - among unarmed victims: Black people were killed at 3x the rate; and Hispanics at 1.45x the rate of White people

538 (Feb. 4, 2021) 
## Summary 
  To help the Biden Administration determine which police departments are in need of federal investigation for discriminatory or unlawful conduct, Samuel Sinyangwe calculated per capita arrest rates and police killing rates for some of the largest police departments in the U.S. 
## Notes
 - Black people were arrested and killed by police at higher rates than White peopel in 34 of the 37 largest cities
