I WAS THE FIRST OPD PATROL UNIT TO ARRIVE IN THE ALLEY. AS I DROVE WEST IN THE ALLEY FROM EVERGLADE STREET, I SAW A MAN STANDING NEXT TO A TRASH DUMPSTER HALFWAY DOWN THE BLOCK. THE RED AND BLUE EMERGENCY LIGTHS OF MY PATROL VEHICLE WERE STILL ACTIVATED. THE MAN, LATER IDENTIFIED AS MEADOR, WAS THROWING SOMETHING INTO THE DUMPSTER. MEADOR LOOKED TOWARDS ME AND SUDDENLY JUMPED INSIDE THE DUMPSTER. I ADVISED DISPATCH WHAT I WAS SEEING SO RESPONDING OFFICERS WOULD ALSO KNOW. I IMMEDIATELY ORDERED MEADOR TO SHOW ME HIS HANDS. WHILE CONCEALED INSIDE THE DUMPSTER, MEADOR YELLED BACK AT ME, ""HAND!!!"", I SOON REALIZED MEADOR YELLED THAT WORD BECAUSE HE IN FACT WAS MISSING HIS RIGHT HAND SO HE ONLY HAD ONE. WITHIN A COUPLE OF MINUTES, MEADOR TOSSED A BLACK COLORED HANDGUN HOLSTER OUT OF THE DUMPSTER INDICATING HE PROBABLY HAD A HANDGUN. MEADOR SOON STOOD UP IN THE DUMPSTER AND DOWSED HIMSELF WITH GASOLINE STORED IN A SMALL RED PASTIC GAS CAN.

I SPENT APPROXIMATELY THE NEXT 20 MINUTES ATTEMPTING TO NEGOTIATE MEADOR INTO SURRENDERING HIS HANDGUN SO I COULD TALK WITH HIM. MEADOR POINTED A SILVER COLORED REVOLVER TO HIS HEAD BUT SOON HELD IT DOWN TO HIS SIDE AS HE ERRATICALLY PACED AROUND INSIDE THE DUMPSTER. I CONTINUED TO PLEAD WITH MEADOR TO TALK TO ME AND I TRIED TO EMPHASIZE BURNING HIMSELF UP AND/OR SHOOTING HIMSELF WAS NOT THE CORRECT THING TO DO. MEADOR MADE STATEMENTS LIKE, ""THERE IS NOTHING YOU CAN DO FOR ME"" AND ""YOU CAN SHOOT MY ASS IF YOU WANT THERE IS NO WAY OUT"" MEADOR STATED, ""YOU DIDN'T HELP ME LAST MONTH"" I REPLIED ""I WAS NOT HERE LAST MONTH BUT I'M HERE NOW, TALK TO ME."" I TRIED TO KEEP MEADOR AWARE THAT HE WASN'T IN TROUBLE AND I JUST AWNTED TO HELP HIM RECEIVE THE HELP HE NEEDED. MEADOR GOT TO THE POINT HE CURSED AT ME MULTIPLE TIMES AND EVENTUALLY STATED, ""I DON'T WANT TO HURT YOU, I JUST WANT TO DIE!"" THROUGHOUT THE NEGOTIATION, MEADOR TUCKED THE REVOLVER UNDER HIS RIGHT ARMPIT AND HELD IT THERE WHILE HE REPEATEDLY POURED MORE GASOLINE ON HIMSELF. DEPUTY US MARSHAL BRENT SHEETS ARRIVED. HE STOOD NEXT TO ME WITH A BALLISTIC SHIELD AND PROVIDED US SOME ADDITIONAL COVER. I DISCUSSED MULTIPLE OPTIONS AND PLANS TO BRING THE SITUATION TO A SUCCESSFUL POSITIVE ENDING BUT MEADOR'S ACTIONS NEGATED THOSE OPTIONS. APPROXIMATELY 20 MINUTES INTO THE NEGOTIATION, MEADOR, HELD THE REVOLVER TO HIS HEAD, PACED AROUND AND STRETCHED. SECONDS LATER, MEADOR LOOKED AT ME AND POINTED THE REVOLVER DIRECTLY AT ME. AT THAT MOMENT, I FEARED MEADOR WAS GOING TO SHOOT BRENT OR MYSELF. MY ONLY OPTION TO STOP, CONTROL OR NEUTRALIZE THE THREAT OF DEADLY FORCE WAS TO FIRE MY PATROL RIFLE AT MEADOR.

TEASDALE #4112, CAMERON PD) WAS DISPATCHED TO 901 E. GILLIS IN CAMERON TEXAS, REFERENCE A STOLEN VEHICLE. THE CALLER, IDENTIFIED AS CECILIA RAMIREZ W/F DOB 4/25/1987, CALLED 911 TO REPORT THAT HER MOTHER’S VEHICLE WAS JUST STOLEN AT GUN POINT. CECILIA STATES HER ESTRANGED HUSBAND RICHARD RAMIREZ CAME TO HER HOME AND DEMANDED THE KEYS TO CECILIA’S MOTHER’S VEHICLE. WHEN CECILIA REFUSED TO GIVE RICHARD THE KEYS, HE PULLED OUT A SHOTGUN AND POINTED IT AT HIS OWN HEAD AND TOLD CECILIA IF SHE DIDN’T GIVE HIM THE KEYS HE WAS GOING TO SHOOT HIMSELF IN THE HEAD. UNDER DURESS CECILIA HANDED OVER THE KEYS TO THE CAR. THE CAR WAS DESCRIBED AS A GREY IN COLOR NISSAN ALTIMA. PAGE 7 OF 9 OFFICER ASHWORTH AND I RESPONDED. WE WERE TOLD BY CHIEF RANDY DIXON THAT HE HAD SEEN THE SUSPECT AND THE VEHICLE AT THE INTERSECTION OF S. CROCKETT AND TYSON STREET. THE SUSPECT WAS SAID TO BE STOPPED AT THE 4-WAY STOP SIGN AND HAD HIS HEAD DOWN ON THE STEERING WHEEL. THE SUSPECT WAS LAST SEEN DRIVING NORTHBOUND ON CROCKETT. OFFICER ASHWORTH AND I CHECKED THE AREA BUT WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE THE SUSPECT VEHICLE. WE RESPONDED TO THE RESIDENCE AT 901 E. GILLIS WHERE THE INCIDENT OCCURRED. I SPOKE WITH CECILIA RAMIREZ WHO STATES THAT RICHARD RAMIREZ CAME TO THE HOUSE AND DEMANDED THE KEYS TO HER MOTHER’S CAR. IT IS UNKNOWN HOW RICHARD ARRIVED AT THE RESIDENCE. CECILIA WAS NOT ABLE TO TELL US IF RICHARD WALKED OR WAS DRIVEN BY ANOTHER PERSON. CECILIA SAYS WHEN SHE REFUSED TO GIVE RICHARD THE KEYS TO HER MOTHER’S CAR, RICHARD PULLED OUT A “SHOTGUN” AND POINTED IT AT HIS HEAD. RICHARD TOLD CECILIA THAT IF SHE DID NOT GIVE HIM THE KEYS TO THE CAR HE WAS GOING TO SHOOT HIMSELF. WE OBTAINED WHAT INFORMATION WE COULD ABOUT THE VEHICLE ITSELF AND OFFICER ASHWORTH AND I LEFT THE RESIDENCE IN AN ATTEMPT TO LOCATE RICHARD AND THE VEHICLE. I AM FAMILIAR WITH RICHARD RAMIREZ BECAUSE I HAVE HAD PREVIOUS DEALINGS WITH HIM. RICHARD RAMIREZ IS A KNOWN USER OF ILLICIT NARCOTICS AND IS KNOWN TO BE IN POSSESSION OF AT LEAST ONE AND OFTEN TWO FIREARMS. OFFICER ASHWORTH AND I CHECKED RESIDENCES OF RICHARD’S FAMILY, INCLUDING A HOUSE ON S. AUSTIN ST. AND A HOUSE ON W. 2ND ST. WE WERE UNABLE TO LOCATE HIM. AS I DROVE NORTHBOUND ON N. TRAVIS STREET FROM W. 4TH ST. I SAW A GRAY IN COLOR NISSAN ALTIMA BEARING TXLP CSD-3130, SITTING AT THE GAS PUMPS AT THE MINI-MART LOCATED AT N. TRAVIS ST AND 7TH ST. I TURNED MY MARKED PATROL UNIT INTO THE PARKING LOT OF THE ARLAN’S GROCERY STORE AND DROVE BACK TOWARDS THE MINI-MART. THE SUSPECT VEHICLE HAD THE DRIVER SIDE DOOR OPEN AND WAS UNOCCUPIED. THERE WAS WHAT APPEARED TO BE A 40 OUNCE BEER SITTING ON THE HOOD. I LOOKED OVER AND SAW RICHARD RAMIREZ, WHO IS KNOWN TO ME, LEANING INTO THE WINDOW OF ANOTHER VEHICLE AT THE GAS PUMPS. IT APPEARED AS THOUGH HE WAS TALKING TO SOMEONE. I NOTIFIED DISPATCH AND OFFICER ASHWORTH VIA RADIO THAT I HAD LOCATED THE SUSPECT AND GAVE MY LOCATION. AS I PULLED IN BEHIND THE SUSPECT VEHICLE IN MY MARKED PATROL UNIT I ACTIVATED MY EMERGENCY LIGHTS. RICHARD LOOKED UP AND SAW ME. HE IMMEDIATELY RAN AND GOT IN THE DRIVER SEAT OF THE NISSAN ALTIMA AND FLED THE SCENE IN A RECKLESS MANNER AND AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED. I TURNED ON MY SIREN IN ADDITION TO THE EMERGENCY LIGHTS. THE PURSUIT WENT NORTHBOUND ON N. TRAVIS AT SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 80MPH. THE SUSPECT VEHICLE TURNED LEFT (WEST) ON 22ND STREET. A DPS TROOPER HAD JOINED IN THE PURSUIT AT OR NEAR THE INTERSECTION OF N. TRAVIS AND 22ND STREET. AS WE APPROACHED THE RAILROAD TRACKS ON W. 22ND STREET THE SUSPECT VEHICLE STOPPED ABRUPTLY LEAVING SKID MARKS. I BEGAN TO EXIT MY PATROL CAR WHEN THE VEHICLE SUDDENLY TOOK OFF AGAIN. THE SUSPECT VEHICLE CONTINUED TO DRIVER RECKLESSLY AND AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED DOWN 22ND STREET UNTIL IT BECAME C.R. 223. AT THE INTERSECTION OF C.R. 223 AND C.R. 2269 THE SUSPECT VEHICLE TURNED LEFT (SOUTH) AND HEADED BACK TOWARDS DOWN. THE SUSPECT VEHICLE WAS DRIVING ERRATICALLY AND SWERVING INTO ONCOMING LANES. THE VEHICLE WOULD SLOW DOWN AND THEN SPEED UP. BECAUSE WE HAD PROBABLE CAUSE TO BELIEVE THE SUSPECT WAS ARMED WITH A SHOTGUN, THIS OFFICER BELIEVED THE SUSPECT WAS EITHER LOOKING FOR A PLACE TO DITCH THE VEHICLE AND RUN ON FOOT OR STOP AND BEGIN FIRING AT THE PURSUING OFFICERS. AT THE INTERSECTION OF C.R. 2269 AND HWY 190 THE SUSPECT VEHICLE TURNED LEFT (EAST) ON HWY 190 AND WENT BACK INTO TOWN. THE SUSPECT VEHICLE TURNED RIGHT (SOUTH) ON BOWIE STREET AND THE PURSUIT CONTINUED AT A HIGH RATE OF SPEED THROUGH MULTIPLE RESIDENTIAL STREETS. THE SUSPECT DROVE BY HIS SISTER-IN-LAW’S HOUSE ON S. AUSTIN AND THEN BY HIS MOTHER-IN-LAW’S HOUSE ON W. 2ND. A GROUP OF THE FAMILY APPEARED TO BE ON THE PORCH ON W. 2ND STREET AND THEY WERE YELLING RICHARD’S NAME AS HE DROVE BY. RICHARD WAVED AT THEM OUT THE WINDOW. HIS DRIVING WAS RECKLESS AND AT HIGH SPEEDS. HE DISREGARDED ALL STOP SIGNS AND HAD NO REGARD FOR PEDESTRIANS OR PROPERTY. THE SUSPECT VEHICLE EVENTUALLY TRAVELED DOWN W. 2ND STREET TO COLUMBUS WHERE HE DROVE BEHIND THE BROOKSHIRE BROTHERS GROCERY STORE. HE SPED THROUGH THE PARKING LOT ON THE SIDE OF BROOKSHIRE BROTHERS AND THEN TURNED LEFT (WEST) ON HWY 190. FROM THERE THE PURSUIT REACHED SPEEDS IN EXCESS OF 100MPH. THE SUSPECT CONTINUED TO DRIVE RECKLESSLY AND SWERVE INTO ONCOMING LANES. I WAS NOTIFIED VIA RADIO THAT RICHARD RAMIREZ HAD CALLED 911 AND WAS ON THE PHONE WITH CHIEF RANDY DIXON. I WAS INFORMED THAT RICHARD SAID HE WAS ARMED AND HE WAS GOING TO SHOOT THE PURSUING OFFICERS. RICHARD SAID HE WAS GOING TO PULL INTO A GAS STATION AND BEGIN SHOOTING OFFICERS AND THE PATRONS OF THE STORE IF OFFICERS APPROACHED HIM. ALL ATTEMPTS TO REASON WITH RICHARD WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. RICHARD WAS ENCOURAGED STRONGLY TO PULL OVER AND SURRENDER. RICHARD’S CONTINUED THREATS OF VIOLENCE TO OFFICERS AND RANDOM CIVILIANS GAVE CAUSE FOR GREAT CONCERN. THE CAMERON POLICE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD SEVERAL RECENT INCIDENTS INVOLVING RICHARD RAMIREZ TO INCLUDE ILLICIT DRUG USE AND POSSESSION WITH CLAIMS THAT HE IS DISTRIBUTING ILLICIT SUBSTANCES. HOME INVASION/BURGLARY, DOMESTIC DISTURBANCES, ASSAULTS, CRIMINAL MISCHIEF AND VEHICLE CRASH IN WHICH HE FLED THE SCENE. MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE REPORTED THAT RICHARD IS ARMED WITH A SAWED-OFF SHOTGUN AND HAS MADE THREATS TOWARDS PAGE 8 OF 9 FAMILY MEMBERS AND DIRECT THREATS TOWARDS LAW ENFORCEMENT IF THEY FAMILY “CALLS THE COPS” ON HIM AGAIN. OFFICER J. MUHAMET WITH CAMERON PD SENT OUT AN OFFICER SAFETY ALERT ONE WEEK PRIOR RELAYING THE THREATS MADE BY RICHARD RAMIREZ. INCIDENTS WITH RICHARD RAMIREZ WERE INCREASING IN FREQUENCY AND SEVERITY AND THIS OFFICER BELIEVES THAT HE POSED AN IMMEDIATE AND DIRECT THREAT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. THE PURSUIT CONTINUED AT HIGH SPEEDS THROUGH THE TOWN OF BUCKHOLTZ AND THEN INTO ROGERS. NEITHER OF THE OFFICERS IN BUCKHOLTZ OR ROGERS WAS ABLE TO DEPLOY SPIKE STRIPS. WE CONTINUED WESTBOUND TOWARDS TEMPLE. AS MUCH NOTIFICATION AS POSSIBLE WAS GIVEN TO TEMPLE PD AND BELL COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE THAT OUR PURSUIT WAS HEADING TOWARDS THEM. AS WE ENTERED TEMPLE TWO ADDITIONAL DPS TROOPERS JOINED IN THE PURSUIT. I AM UNCERTAIN HOW MANY PURSUING OFFICERS WERE BEHIND ME BUT I BELIEVE IT TO BE ABOUT 5 OR 6 MARKED UNITS. WHEN THE TWO ADDITIONAL TROOPERS JOINED I ALLOWED THEM TO GET IN FRONT OF ME AND TAKE THE LEAD IN THE PURSUIT. AS WE ENTERED THE CITY LIMITS OF TEMPLE, TWO TEMPLE PD UNITS ATTEMPTED TO DEPLOY SPIKE STRIPS BUT WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. THE PURSUIT CONTINUED INTO TEMPLE AND THROUGH THE DOWNTOWN AREA. RICHARD RAMIREZ CONTINUED TO DRIVE AT HIGH SPEEDS AND RECKLESSLY. AT ONE POINT I COULD SEE RICHARD HAD HIS LEFT ARM OUT THE WINDOW OF THE CAR AND IT APPEARED HE WAS HOLDING HIS CELL PHONE IN HIS HAND AS IF HE WERE TAKING PICTURES OF VIDEO OF THE PURSUING OFFICERS. WHEN THE PURSUIT TURNED DOWN AVENUE G IN TEMPLE WE DROVE PASSED A PARK THAT WAS FULL OF CHILDREN. RICHARD HAD SLOWED DOWN AND APPEARED TO BE LOOKING AT THE PARK. AT THE INTERSECTION OF AVENUE G AND 25TH STREET RICHARD TOOK A RIGHT AT THE “T” INTERSECTION. THE TWO LEAD PURSUING DPS UNITS FOLLOWED HIM. I OBSERVED THE SUSPECT VEHICLE IMMEDIATELY TURN INTO THE PARKING LOT OF A TIRE SHOP. THE SUSPECT VEHICLE HAD TURNED AROUND AND WAS NOW TRAVELING BACK TOWARDS ALL THE PURSUING UNITS AND I BELIEVED HE WAS INTENTIONALLY ATTEMPTING TO RETURN TO THE PARK WE HAD PASSED SO THAT HE COULD CARRY OUT THE THREATS HE HAD MADE ON THE PHONE. AT THAT TIME I MADE THE DECISION TO END THE PURSUIT AND PREVENT RICHARD FROM DRIVING BACK TOWARDS THE PARK. I SHARPLY TURNED MY MARKED PATROL UNIT INTO THE PARKING LOT OF THE TIRE SHOP AND STRUCK THE SUSPECT VEHICLE WITH MY PATROL VEHICLE. THE FRONT OF MY PATROL VEHICLE STRUCK THE SUSPECT VEHICLE ON THE FRONT RIGHT SIDE AND THE SUSPECT VEHICLE STOPPED. AS I EXITED MY PATROL VEHICLE SO THAT I COULD DETAIN RICHARD RAMIREZ I OBSERVED HIM RAISE A RED IN COLOR SHOTGUN AT ME. HE USED HIS LEFT HAND AND APPEARED TO RAISE THE SHOTGUN FROM EITHER THE FRONT PASSENGER SEAT OR THE PASSENGER SIDE FLOORBOARD. WITH AN IMMEDIATE FEAR FOR MY LIFE, I DREW MY DEPARTMENT ISSUED DUTY WEAPON AND FIRED SEVERAL ROUNDS.
