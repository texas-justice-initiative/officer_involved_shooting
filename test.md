# OFFICER-INVOLVED SHOOTINGS IN TEXAS: 2016-2019

*The Texas Justice Initiative (TJI) is a nonprofit organization that collects, analyzes, publishes and provides oversight for criminal justice data throughout Texas. This “Officer-Involved Shootings in Texas" report analyzes data from reports filed for shootings over a four-year period. The goal of this report is to identify patterns and make comparisons of officer and civilian injuries and deaths during officer-involved (OIS) shooting incidents across a variety of variables.*

## I. Executive Summary
Texas law requires the Office of the Attorney General (OAG) to collect reports on all officer-involved shootings throughout Texas and then provide the summary of the individual reports in “The Peace Officer Involved Shooting Annual Reports.” The OAG digitally publishes these annual reports, which are extremely high-level summaries, with no findings or analysis of trends or intersectionality. Texas Justice Initiative (TJI) reviewed the officer-involved shooting incidents data from law enforcement agencies in Texas between 2016 and 2019. This TJI publication improves upon the OAG’s annual reports by providing in-depth analyses with more granular information. **This report consists of two parts**:
- The **Data Summary** section provides an overview of the incidents as intersectional information such as the total number of civilian severities per county and per race demographics.
- The **Data Insight** section provides TJI’s independent analysis of the officer-involved shootings, including notable patterns in the data.
